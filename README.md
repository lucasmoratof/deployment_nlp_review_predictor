## About this project

As part of learning Machine Learning models, it's not very often that we think about how it will be used in production when it's ready.

Flask offers a simple yet efficient solution to see how a model can be deployed. Here you find all the files I've created in order to make it run.

After downloading, you should be able to run it easily. Just go to your terminal, find the folder where the files are and type *python app.py*. Then it will make you able to access the link http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your navigator, and a window will open with a box where you can try to type a review, in Portuguese as the training data was on that language. When you click in predict, the model will run and came up with a prediction if your review is positive or negative.

Have fun, and please write back to me for comments.

My reference to build the html and css files was this amazing post: https://towardsdatascience.com/develop-a-nlp-model-in-python-deploy-it-with-flask-step-by-step-744f3bdd7776
